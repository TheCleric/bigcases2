  <p class="lead">
    The Big Cases Bot provides updates about the most important cases in the country to an audience of more
    than 50,000 attorneys, journalists, and court watchers.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Bot is sponsored, it purchases PDFs from PACER to share in its posts as links and thumbnails. This allows
    the public to easily read the important documents of the moment, and ensures that those documents are contributed to
    RECAP and the Internet Archive for long term preservation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sponsors of the Bot are recognized for their support in the thumbnails the bot posts, which are watermarked with your
    message (typically something like, "This update sponsored by Acme Law, Inc.").
  </p>
  <p>To sponsor the Bot, please get in touch and we'll go over the details.</p>

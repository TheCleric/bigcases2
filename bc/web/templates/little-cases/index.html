  <p class="lead">The Big Cases bot follows the biggest cases in the country, but many people want updates for specific topics they follow.</p>
  <p>To address this, we created Little Cases bots that can follow these important topics in American society and jurisprudence.</p>
  <p>Little bots are supported by <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a>, but the cases followed by each bot are selected by community members or organizations that are experts on particular areas of the law.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in an area of the law that you think deserves its own Twitter bot, let us know using the button below. We'll get back to you as soon as possible with a plan for action.</p>
